        <h1>Multi-Yatzy</h1>
            <p>This page introduces the Multi-Yatzy game. It describes the game background, its rules, and a guide on how to execute it.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Multi-yatzy is an extension of the popular and well-known <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy" target="_blank">Yatzy dice game</a>. It is normally played with 5 <a href="#dice-picture">6-valued fair dice</a>. However, in this extension the game can be configured with any number of dice between 5 and 20.</p>

            <p>This version is played by a single simple computer player.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>The game consists of playing 15 rounds. In each round, the player makes a single roll of the chosen number of dice. Then the computer calculates the score that can be achieved with the given dice roll and round type, and registers the score in a scoreboard.</p>
